# homework-5-workday-scheduler

Created a simple work day planner/scheduler that will allow the user to save events through out the work day, such as meetings, conference calls, lunch etc. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

After inputting an event in the time slot, clicking on the save button will store the time and user input on the server.
